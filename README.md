# Ansible Collection - openstack.kolla

The Ansible openstack.kolla collection provides Ansible plugins, modules and
roles for OpenStack Kolla projects, including Kolla Ansible and Kayobe.

Kolla projects deploy OpenStack services and infrastructure components in
Docker containers.

Kolla's mission statement is:

    To provide production-ready containers and deployment tools for operating
    OpenStack clouds.

Kolla is highly opinionated out of the box, but allows for complete
customization. This permits operators with little experience to deploy
OpenStack quickly and as experience grows modify the OpenStack
configuration to suit the operator's exact requirements.
